/**
 * The fork() system call is strange; its partner in crime, exec(), is not so normal either. 
 * What it does: given the name of an executable (e.g., wc), and some arguments (e.g., callForkWaitExec.c), 
 * it loads code (and static data) from that executable 
 * and overwrites its current code segment (and current static data) with it; 
 * the heap and stack and other parts of the memory space of the program are re-initialized. 
 * Then the OS simply runs that program, passing in any arguments as the argv of that process. 
 * 
 * Thus, it does not create a new process; rather, 
 * it transforms the currently running program (formerly callForkWaitExec) 
 * into a different running program (wc). 
 * 
 * After the exec() in the child, it is almost as if callForkWaitExec.c never ran; 
 * a successful call to exec() never returns.
