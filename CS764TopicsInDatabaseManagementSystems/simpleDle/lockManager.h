/**
 * Difference between a class and a struct in C++:
 * structs have default public members and bases and classes have default private members and 
 * bases. Both classes and structs can have a mixture of public and private members, can use 
 * inheritance, and can have member functions. I would recommend using structs as plain-old-data 
 * structures without any class-like features, and using classes as aggregate data structures with 
 * private data and member functions.
